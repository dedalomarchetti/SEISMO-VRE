# SEISMO-VRE
This is a Virtual Research Environment (VRE) in the form of Jupyter Notebook with MATLAB or Python kernel dedicated to a multiparametric and multidisciplinary study of an earthquake.  
It integrates geophysical, atmospheric, and solar datasets to support interdisciplinary research.
The first developed version is the one with the MATLAB kernel, so for eventual differences, this is the reference VRE.

## Requirements 
### for MATLAB Version 

- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/)
- MATLAB with the [MATLAB kernel for Jupyter](https://github.com/Calysto/matlab_kernel)
- MATLAB Toolboxes: 'Mapping', 'Statistics and Machine Learning' and 'Curve Fitting'
- (Optional) Python environment via Anaconda or similar
### for Python version
- see the specific file `requirements.txt`

## How to Run (*)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dedalomarchetti/SEISMO-VRE.git
   cd SEISMO-VRE
   ```

2. Start Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open `SEISMO-VRE_MATLAB_v1.0.ipynb` and follow the instructions inside. For Phyton version, please, open instead `SEISMO-VRE_Python_v1.0.ipynb`.

\* If you want to just view the Notebook you can simply click inside GitHub on the file `VRE_Amatrice_v1.5.ipynb` to preview it inside the same GitHub.
